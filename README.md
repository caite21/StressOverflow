# StressOverflow Android App Development
Forked from the original team repo [here](https://github.com/CMPUT301F23T02/StressOverflow) to edit the documentation. Also, note that my contributions to the team repo were from two different accounts (caite21 and Caite Sklar).

**StressOverflow was created by: caite21, Mcnuget5, sagiksmnv, xirui1219, and Ying-SunWan**
